An imcomplete program, called 'buffer_incomplete.c' is given. Your job is to fill the insert_item() and remove_item(), which should use semaphores as well as mutex lock to synchronize producers and consumers to access the buffer (NOTE: The book asks to only use semaphores). An output file called 'output_buffer_producer_consumer.txt', after command line input './a.out 20 5 5 > output.txt',  is also given. Please study both files carefully. The output of your program should look similar.
Extra points: 20 points.
1). 10pts. There are 5 producer threads and 5 consumer threads using above command line input, please print out the ID of each specific producer/consumer.
2). 10pts. Due to race condition, the time a produder tries to insert into the buffer is not necessarily the time it succeeds in insertion; similarly, the time a consumer tries to remove from the buffer could be different from the time it actually removes. Please printout the time of each if it occurs.
Please submit a zip file titled "541_proj2_LastName1_LastName2_LastName3.zip",  which include a folder of the same name; it has
1. the completed source program called 'buffer.c' and
2. README file, including i) how to compile and run your programs, team members' name and each's specific contribution to the project, ii) five screen shots of the successful exections of your programs
3. Any other observations/finding that you want to mention in your experiment.
