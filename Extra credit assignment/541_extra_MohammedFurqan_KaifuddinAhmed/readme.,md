# Disk Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

## Project Overview
This comprehensive disk scheduling simulation provides an in-depth analysis of three fundamental disk scheduling algorithms: 
 1.First-Come, First-Served (FCFS),
 2. SCAN (Elevator)
 3. Circular SCAN (C-SCAN).

## Project Structure
- `fcfs_scheduler.py`: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Algorithm Implementation
- `scan_scheduler.py`: SCAN (Elevator) Algorithm Implementation
- `cscan_scheduler.py`: Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) Algorithm Implementation
- `main_scheduler.py`: Simulation Execution and Comparison Module

## Features
- Flexible disk configuration
- Random cylinder request generation
- Detailed performance reporting
- Algorithm comparison
- Robust error handling
- Reproducible random seed generation

## Execution Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the simulation:
   ```
   python main_scheduler.py
   ```
4. Follow on-screen prompts to configure:
   - Total disk cylinders
   - Number of cylinder requests
   - Initial head position

## Algorithm Performance Insights
### First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Simplest scheduling approach
- No optimization of head movement
- Predictable but potentially inefficient

### SCAN (Elevator)
- Reduces head movement by moving in one direction
- Services requests in a sweeping motion
- More efficient than FCFS

### Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)
- Provides more uniform wait times
- Ensures consistent service across disk regions
- Often the most efficient for random request patterns

## Recommended Usage
- Experiment with different cylinder configurations
- Compare algorithm performance
- Understand disk scheduling trade-offs

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Mohammed Furqan : writing fcfs and circular scan scode 
2. Kaifuddin Ahmed: writing the main and Scan algorithm code. 

## Potential Improvements
- Add more detailed logging
- Implement additional scheduling algorithms
- Create visualization of head movements
